## About the Project

Lunar Lander is a web-based game developed with JavaScript that challenges your skills in successfully maneuvering a spacecraft.

The game simulates a lunar landing environment, where the player's goal is to land safely on the Moon's surface. To do this, you must land on a blinking green zone while keeping your speed below 1.5 to ensure a safe touchdown.

## How to Play
- Control the spacecraft using the keyboard.
- Monitor your fuel to avoid running out before landing.
- Land on a blinking green zone at a speed below 1.5 to succeed.
- Crashing or landing too fast will result in failure!
